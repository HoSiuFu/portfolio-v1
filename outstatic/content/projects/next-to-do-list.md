This project is quite simple as it served as an introduction to **Next.js** and a good practice for **Typescript**, which I had just learned recently, and wanted to improve on, and it was only logical because I have already previous experience with **React**. This project is based on a tutorial made by [Web Dev Simplefied](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified), to see the specific tutorial [follow this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgayZAuTgwM).

The project is not a one-to-one replica of the tutorial, as I decided to experiment with other **Next.js** features to see if I understood what was done in the tutorial, and could expand on it with the information given by the **Next.js** documentation and other sources.

I also decided to use **SCSS/SASS**, which I have already worked with, instead of **Tailwind CSS.** The reasoning for this was that I wanted to focus on learning and improving my skills with **Next.js** and to have the minimum risk of distraction from learning other tools, although I learned the basics of **Prisma**, which is an ORM that handles the creation of the database models as well as handling operations done on the database when executed on the app.

I decided to experiment with a **Yarn** as a package manager for this project to see the differences between it and **NPM**, which I have always used since the beginning.
