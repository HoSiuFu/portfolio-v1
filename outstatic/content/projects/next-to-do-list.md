This project is quite simple, as it served as an introduction to **Next.js** and a good practice for **Typescript**, which I had just learned recently and wanted to improve on, and it was only logical because I already have previous experience with **React**. This project is based on a tutorial made by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified). To see the specific tutorial, [follow this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgayZAuTgwM).

 &nbsp;

The project is not a one-to-one replica of the tutorial, as I decided to experiment with other **Next.js** features to see if I understood what was done in the tutorial and could expand on it with the information given by the **Next.js** documentation and other sources.

  &nbsp;

I also decided to use **SCSS/SASS**, which I have already worked with, instead of **Tailwind CSS.** The reasoning for this was that I wanted to focus on learning and improving my skills with **Next.js** and to have the minimum risk of distraction from learning other tools, although I learned the basics of **Prisma**, which is an ORM that handles the creation of the database models as well as handling operations done on the database when executed on the app.

  &nbsp;

For this project, I went with a **Yarn** as a package manager to see the differences between it and **NPM**, which I have used since the beginning.

  &nbsp;

## What was learned from this tutorial?

While doing this tutorial, I understood how to create a Next.js project, how to create server-side and client-side components, and what the differences are between them both; server-side actions that were introduced on Next.js v.13 as an experimental feature; routing works through the file system, as well as how to use layouts and pages.

  &nbsp;

There were also some lessons learned while creating extra features while free exploring, for example, synchronization issues between operations that edit/delete information with the database and the information displayed on the server-side components. This happens because the data can be cached, and in this case, it was.

  &nbsp;

I learned a bit about Prisma, but nothing too complex, so I can't say I've learned enough of the ins and outs of the tool, but just enough to start using it, like creating a schema, generating the database, migrating changes, creating data, etc.
