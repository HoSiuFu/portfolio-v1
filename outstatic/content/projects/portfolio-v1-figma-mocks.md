This is the project that serves as the skeleton of this whole website/portfolio. This project is a result of everything that I have learned while using Figma at my previous job and all the experiments done outside my job.

 &nbsp;

This project is still being worked on as the portfolio is still receiving updates and improvements.

  &nbsp;

## What can be seen in this project?

All the mocks of the components used in the project, as well as the pages that are present on the website, of course for some pages there are just placeholder content as that content is supposed to be dynamic, but for certain pages, they are almost a carbon copy of each other.

  &nbsp;

You can also see the resulting prototyping of all the pages and components done in this project.
